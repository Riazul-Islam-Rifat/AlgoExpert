# Time complexity:
The time complexity for this solution is O(n*m) where n is the length of the given array "words" and
m is the largest string of the  words array.

# Space complexity:
Here space complexity is constant O(1) as I am not using any separate set/list.
Note: Use set if strings are not unique in the words array.
