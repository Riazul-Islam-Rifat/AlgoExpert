Time complexity:
O(N) --> Both for iterative and recursive solution

Space Complexity:
O(N) --> For iterative solution [Roughly MAX N/2 leaf nodes will be in the queue] O(N/2)--> O(N)
O(D) or O(logN)  --> For recursive call stack. Depth of a binary tree is O(logN)

## N is the number of nodes in the tree.
