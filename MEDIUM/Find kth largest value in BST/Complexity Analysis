Time complexity:
O(h+k)
--> O(h+k)-> To find the node that we are gonna visiting we need to traverse to it and at this will take at most O(h) times.
--> We have to go down the tree at most h time and after we have gone down the tree h times,
--> we are gonna have to visit k nodes. So time complexity O(h+K)

Space complexity:
O(h) --> As storing recursive calls in recursive stack
