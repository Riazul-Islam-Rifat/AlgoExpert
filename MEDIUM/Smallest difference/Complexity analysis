# Time complexity
- Assuming N is the length of arrayOne and M is the length of arrayTwo
O(NlogN) + O(MlogM)
O(N+M) doesn't have any effect over O(NlogN) + O(MlogM). [O(N+M) for while loop.]

# Space Complexity:
O(1) [Constant space] as we are not storing anything that depends on the length of input.
