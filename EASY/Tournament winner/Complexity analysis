Time complexity:
O(n) as given competitions/ results array is iterated.

Space Complexity:
O(K) K is the number of teams participated in the competition.
O(k+1) --> +1 for the current best team.

Name of each string contains 30 characters. Hence space complexity O(30k+1)
But constant 30 and +1 is omitted. So the space complexity is O(n)
