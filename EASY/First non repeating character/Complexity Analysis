Time complexity:
O(n) as we are traversing the given string of length n.
2 for loops. Hence O(n+n)==> O(2n) == O(n)

Space complexity:
O(1)
Though a dictionary is used but it's length can never be greater than 26 as input string only contains lower case
English alphabet. Max length could be O(26) == O(1) # As constant.
